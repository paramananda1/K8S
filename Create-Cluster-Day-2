  cluster will include the following physical resources: 
  One master node  ( The master node (a node in Kubernetes refers to a server) is responsible for managing the state of the cluster. It runs Etcd, which stores cluster data among components that schedule workloads to worker nodes.)
  
 Two worker nodes
 
 
 Generate ssh key pair to comunicate between nodes

 ssh-keygen  Enter  Enter Enter Enter
 Now RSA key created:
 ~/.ssh/id_rsa: The private key. DO NOT SHARE THIS FILE!
~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub: The associated public key. This can be shared freely without consequence.
 
 Generate an SSH Key Pair with a Larger Number of Bits  (SSH keys are 2048 bits by default. )
 ssh-keygen -b 4096
 Overwrite (y/n)?  Y
 
 ssh-keygen -l
